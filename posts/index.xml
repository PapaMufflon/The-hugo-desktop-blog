      <description>After being limited with the simple textbox I used before for entering text, I decided to switch to an alternative.
Monaco text editor That was a hard fight getting the Monaco Editor to work with this electron-vue-application. In the end, everything looks simple, but these are the best and hardest solutions ;)
So let me show you the present state of the editor-view:
With it come all the bells and wistles Microsoft and other open source developers integrate into this piece of software: syntax highlighting, line numbers, a mini map and a lot of options for me to extend it.</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s done (not really) Awesome, this will be the first blog entry written with the pre-alpha prototypy hugo-desktop app (working title&amp;hellip;). What do I have so far?
 I can set up a new blog (obviously) with a default theme (Minimalist) The new blog is created with its own git repository with the theme as a submodule When you write markdown, you immediately see the new article in the side view or in a browser (via the hugo dev server) There are some basic markdown helpers like for headings, links and: images!</description>

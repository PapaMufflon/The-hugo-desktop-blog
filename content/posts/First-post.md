# It's done (not really)
Awesome, this will be the first blog entry written with the pre-alpha prototypy hugo-desktop app (working title...). What do I have so far?

- I can set up a new blog (obviously) with a default theme ([Minimalist](https://github.com/digitalcraftsman/hugo-minimalist-theme))
- The new blog is created with its own git repository with the theme as a submodule
- When you write markdown, you immediately see the new article in the side view or in a browser (via the hugo dev server)
- There are some basic markdown helpers like for headings, links and: images!

The images are stored in the cloud on [cloudinary](cloudinary.com). With its awesome API, the connection was a breeze!

That's it more or less. Not much, but this is hopefully only the beginning. As the app grows, I will write more blog posts covering the new features.
